- Incorporate your actual name.
- Reuse username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you'll be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, etc.

## <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> `AE 01 - UN Votes` 

Create your first data visualization!

- Log on to RStudio Cloud and click `Projects` then open this project `MEP_R`
- Make a copy of the project for this application exercise and launch it.
- In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `UN_votes.Rmd` it's in the `Tutorial` folder. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.
- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
- Then, change the country names to those you're interested in. Your spelling and capitalization should match how the countries appear in the data, so take a peek at the Appendix to confirm spelling. Knit again. And voila, your first data visualization!
