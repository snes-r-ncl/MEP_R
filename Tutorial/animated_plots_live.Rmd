```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Packages

We will use a few packages for this, including `ggplot2` for making plots, `gganimate` for animating them, and `gapminder` for the data. This is what we will end up with:

## Loading packages

First we need to load the packages:

```{r package load, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
library(gapminder)
```

## Have a quick look at the data:

```{r data}
head(gapminder)
str(gapminder)
```


## Now we will start to build the plot

```{r , echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```
